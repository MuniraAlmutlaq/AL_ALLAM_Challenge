# AL Scanning Tool 🦾 📝

- The AL project - is a scanning tool that works with image and text processing - arabic language supported.

This tool works on a website, where the user can upload or drag & drop the image and crop it if needed to start the image and text processing.

At the end, the output will appear on the screen at the left of the full or cropped image, and after that, the user can copy the output manually, via the copy button,
or download .txt file.

In addition, if the user wants to scan another image, the delete button will delete the previous image and text, and then the user can redo the process once again.
